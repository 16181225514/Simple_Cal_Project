# Simple_Cal_Project
My first project that I have added into github. It was a scientific calculator that has multiple function other than normal addition, subtraction operations like sin, cos, tan, log, e, squareroot and Pi to do so.
Even though its a simple one but more responsive and usesfull.Makes it also had a history option that helps to store previous calculations, so no need to worry if you clear it by mistake.
